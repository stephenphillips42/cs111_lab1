We don't have anything for special characters (e.g. \t, \n, etc.). We also 
consider apostrophes, quotations, grave accents as errors too. We do implement 
everything needed for test-p-ok.sh and gives appropriate errors and error 
messages including line numbers. There is some dummy code to allow the 
makefile compilation to work (gets rid of "argument not used" errors). The 
code does not change anything in the read-command.c file.
