From Part 1A:
We don't have anything for special characters (e.g. \t, \n, etc.). We also 
consider apostrophes, quotations, grave accents as errors too. We do implement 
everything needed for test-p-ok.sh and gives appropriate errors and error 
messages including line numbers. There is some dummy code to allow the 
makefile compilation to work (gets rid of "argument not used" errors). The 
code does not change anything in the read-command.c file.

For Part 1B:
We have added the code to execute commands in the shell. Now it only does it 
sequentially, and the parallelization will be added in later. It passes all 
the test cases we give it, and returns the output as bash does. It waits for 
all the child processes spawned in it to close before returning.

Note that there is one race condition in our shell. If you have pipe with one 
side being a subshell that uses a file that the other side uses directly for 
its output, there will be a race condition, that will sometimes work and 
sometimes not.
